## What I did:
Implemented the extended eucledian algorithm. Finished the rest of the key generation algorithm.

## Progress:
Extended Eucledian Algorithm implemented. The rest of key generation implemented.
Added some tests with large numbers.

## What I learned:
More modular arithmentic

## What was unclear/hard:
It's hard to verify if my keys are generated correctly.

## What's next:
Figure out how the client should get access to the keys (write to file, std::out) and how the UI for that should be, and maybe start working on encrypting messages.

## Time used: 
8 h
