## The general structure of the program

The program is a CLI tool that can be used to generate a pair of keys, encrypt a message with a given key and decrypt a message with a given key.

The program code is structured as follows:
- `src/main.rs` contains the main function that is the entry point of the program and the CLI interface. The CLI interface is implemented using the [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/2.33.3/clap/) crate.
- `src/algorithms` contains the implementations of the algorithms used in the program. These include the Miller-Rabin primality test, the Extended Euclidean algorithm and a modular exponentiation function.
- `src/keys.rs` contains the implementation of the `Key` struct, which is used to represent a key, and the `KeyPair` struct, which is used to represent a RSA keypair. Methods related to the keys, including key genereation, encryption and decryption functions are also implemented in this file.

## Achived time and space complexity

The worst-case time complexity of the Euclidean algorithm is O(h), where h is the number of digits in the smaller of the integers under consideration.

The worst-case time complexity for the Miller-Rab test is O(k logÂ³ n), where k is the number of iterations used in the test and n is the integer under consideration.

Since the algorithms used in the implementation of the program have closely followed the sources mentioned below, they achieve these time requirements.

However, more important than the time and space complexity is the correctness testing of the RSA encryption keys, which is the focus of the automated testing.

## Deficiencies and improvements

The program implements the RSA cryptosystem, but it is not secure. The program does not implement secure padding, which is a crucial part of the RSA cryptosystem. Without padding the program is vulnerable to attacks such as the [chosen ciphertext attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-ciphertext_attack).

The program functions therefore only as a demonstration of the RSA cryptosystem and is not suitable for real world use.

To make the program secure, a padding scheme such as [OAEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding) should be implemented, as well as larger key sizes.
