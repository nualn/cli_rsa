## What I did:
Read up on the math behing the Miller-Rabin primality test.
Initialized the project and started implementing key generation.

## Progress:
Miller-Rabin primality test is implemented and tested. 
Also implemented right-to-left binary modular exponentiation.

## What I learned:
A lot about primes and modular arithmetic.
Some more about the Rust language.

## What was unclear/hard:
Modular math is pretty hard to wrap my head around. I think I'll need to do some more reading on the subject.

## What's next:
Implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and finish the key generation algorithm.

## Time used: 
20 h
