## What I did:
Mostly looking into different topics and contemplating what to pick. I ended up choosing RSA, since encryption is such an important part of software security and I would really like to better understand how exactly it works.

## Progress:
Picked algorithm and added specification document.

## What was unclear/hard:
It's hard to decide what algorithm to commit to. 

## What's next:
I'll begin implementing the key generation algorithm.

## Time used: 
4h.
